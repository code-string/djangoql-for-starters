django and graphql starter app...
# Clone 


This app is a demonstration of some basic functionalities in django rest framework while taking advantage of django user capabilities without any external user management packages.
The following features are provided:
  
  * User registration
  * Logging user in
  * Logging user out


I will be adding graphql funtionality to this application. User registration will be accessed via rest while some other actions via graphql
